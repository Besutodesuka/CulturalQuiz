    "answer": "A thread can drink coffee while executing",
    "reason": "Threads are not physical beings and cannot consume beverages. They're units of execution, not interns."

    "question": "Question 2:",
    "options": [
      "The CPU runs only on solar power",
      "Processes can be blocked while waiting for I/O",
      "Threads are lighter weight than processes",
      "Thread switching is usually faster than process switching",
      "Deadlock can occur when processes wait on each other"
    ],
    "answer": "The CPU runs only on solar power",
    "reason": "CPUs require electrical power and do not run on solar energy unless the entire machine is powered by a solar-powered source."

      "Virtual memory allows programs to use more memory than physically available",

    "answer": "A process can teleport to another computer without network",
    "reason": "Processes can't 'teleport'â€”communication between machines requires a network or explicit transfer methods like RPC or distributed systems."
