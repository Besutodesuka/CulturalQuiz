Superiors make decisions without needing input, and it's normal for children or employees to obey without question. Respect for authority is expected. In low PDI countries, people prefer equality. Parents are open to children speaking up, and managers often ask employees for opinions. Power is shared more equally, and relationships are more democratic. Simply put, high PDI means more acceptance of authority and inequality, while low PDI means more equality and open communication."
